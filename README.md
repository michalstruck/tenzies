<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

Tenzies is a second project I started during a React course on Scrimba. It's a simple game, creation of which gave me strong fundamentals to build on later. Of course, I rebuilt it, changed styling, added a Scoreboard - measuring time it took to finish the game, number of rolls...see for yourself!

### Built With

Nothing spectacular, just plain Typescript React.

- [React.js](https://reactjs.org/)
